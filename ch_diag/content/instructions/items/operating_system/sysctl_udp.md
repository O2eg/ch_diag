# Kernel UDP Parameters

This instruction belongs to report item `operating_system.sysctl_udp`. The item is backed by `operating_system.sysctl_udp` (local host script).

## What this item shows
- Kernel IPv4 UDP memory and buffer settings.
- Runtime UDP capacity context for DNS, metrics, logging, or extension traffic.

## What to watch
- UDP buffer pressure or low limits on hosts with heavy metrics/logging traffic.
- Values inconsistent with the platform baseline.

## Common fault causes
- Default sysctl values.
- High monitoring packet volume.
- Configuration drift.

## Automatic evaluation
- No severity is assigned because ClickHouse itself does not normally use UDP and adjacent services differ by deployment.
- Only readable runtime `net.ipv4.udp*` keys are shown; IPv6 and persistence are outside this item.

## Checklist
- Confirm whether ClickHouse-adjacent tooling uses UDP on this host.
- Compare with packet-drop evidence outside this report.
- Persist approved changes through configuration management.
